# Habitude Checklist — Obsidian Plugin

A 7-day habit checklist for Obsidian: add habits, tap days to check them off, track streaks and weekly completion rates, and open a weekly review. Markdown-native — your data lives in your vault as plain markdown.

## Data layout (in your vault)

Under the configured data folder (default `Habitude/`):

```
Habitude/
  Habits.md            # habit registry, one "## <id>" section per habit
  Log/
    2026-09-15.md      # daily log: "- [x] morning-run <!-- Morning run -->"
```

Both files are human-readable and hand-editable. The plugin re-reads them on every render (and on vault `modify` events), so edits you make directly in the notes are picked up automatically.

## Features

- **Checklist view** (ribbon icon, or command *Open checklist*): habits × 7-day grid, click a cell to toggle. Week navigation (‹ ›), per-habit streak (🔥) and weekly %.
- **Add habits** inline; **archive** via the ⋯ menu next to the habit name.
- **Progress graphs** (in the checklist view): per-habit 30-day history strip and trailing 8-week completion bars, rendered locally as SVG — no network involved.
- **Share progress** (button in the checklist view, opt-in): posts aggregate statistics to `https://habi.sh/api/share` and copies a `https://habi.sh/s/<id>` link. Only runs when you click it.
- **Weekly review** (command *Open weekly review* or the button in the view): per-habit completion bars, total checks.
- **Command** *Toggle today for a habit*: quick toggle from the command palette.
- **Status bar**: today's progress (`✓ 3/5 today`).
- **AI coach** (ribbon icon, or command *Open AI coach*): chat with a coach that knows your habits — your streaks, weekly rates, and weekday patterns are shared with the model automatically as statistics. Bring your own key (BYOK): Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter, or a local model via Ollama / LM Studio.

- **Settings** (`Settings → Habitude checklist`): data folder, week start day (Mon/Sun), AI provider, API key, model, base URL, coach language.
- **Get AI coaching** footer button: opens `https://habitude.ai` in your browser.

## Privacy

- **Checklist: fully local.** Habit tracking never calls any API, opens no connections, and holds no credentials. Your habits live in your vault as plain Markdown.
- **Progress graphs: fully local.** Rendered in the app from your check data as SVG. No network involved.
- **Share progress: explicit opt-in.** 공유하기는 사용자가 직접 누를 때만 동작하며, 전송되는 데이터는 습관 제목·스트릭·완료율 같은 집계 통계뿐이고 노트 내용은 포함되지 않습니다. The payload is `{version, pluginVersion, generatedAt, stats: {habits: [{title, streak, weekRate}]}}` posted to `https://habi.sh/api/share`; nothing is sent unless you click the button.
- **AI coach: opt-in BYOK.** The coach only activates if you pick a provider and — for cloud providers — paste your own API key (free tiers exist for Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter). The key is stored only on this device, and requests go **directly to the provider you selected** — never to Habitude servers. Each message carries your habit *statistics* (streaks, rates, patterns), never your raw note text. Local providers (Ollama, LM Studio) need no key at all.
- The only other thing that ever leaves Obsidian is you: the *Get AI coaching* button opens `https://habitude.ai` in your browser.
